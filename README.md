# DartAndFlutter-LinuxInstaller
These two scripts automate the installation process of Dart, and also of Flutter. This script is made only for linux.

Why I have make this script?

Honestly, when I went to install this fantastic language called Dart, I found myself having to write a lot of commands, and although it took a short time, I realized that it would be better to program an installer for linux

## How to run the installer:
    bash dart_installer.sh
### If you want to install both the Dart and the flutter package:
      bash dart_installer.sh && flutter_install.sh
      
Enjoy and Happy Conding!
